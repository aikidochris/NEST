/*
  BASELINE (already applied manually in Supabase)

  Purpose:
  - Records the current expected schema state as of 2025-12-14.
  - This file is NOT meant to be re-run on a fresh DB.
  - All future changes must be additive migrations after this file.

  Notes:
  - If we spin up a fresh Supabase project later, we will produce a true
    "init schema" migration from scratch and replace this baseline.
